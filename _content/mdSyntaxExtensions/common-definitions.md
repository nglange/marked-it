The following are a common list of attributes that are commonly used and supported in the IBM Cloud documentation. You must list them at the top of the file under the metadata information. You can list them and never use them in the body of the file; but having them there makes it easy to access and call them at any time when making updates to your topic.

`{:pre: .pre}`    
`{:screen: .screen}`    
`{:tip: .tip}`
