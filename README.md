# github.com/IBM/marked-it
This repository is for a Markdown generator and the specification documenting it at:
https://pages.github.com/marked-it/

# Built on docs-starter
The gitpages of this tool would not exist without the _fantastic_ project [Docs Starter](http://github.ibm.com/Jason-Lengstorf/docs-starter) by Jason Lengstorf. We are most grateful...

# Contributing

We love help! Please feel welcome to open PRs for the code or the docs.
